This is the steps to setup SSH on github:

1. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

Here is the history of commands.

#Creates SSH key on your computer
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mislam4@kent.edu"
#Print the public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

You also need to the public to Github website using:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account


2. Once those are done, use ssh version of the repository to clone the repo:

e.g. git@github.com:tamimcse/useful-scripts.git

Not https://github.com/tamimcse/useful-scripts.git
